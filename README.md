**Rick and Morty Characters App:**

-  This is a simple iOS application that displays information about characters from the animated TV show, Rick and Morty. The app retrieves character data from the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com) and displays it in a user-friendly way.

**Features:**

- Character List: View a list of all Rick and Morty characters, along with their name, image, and status.
- Character Details: View detailed information about a selected character, including their species, gender, and origin location.
- Episode List: View a list of all Rick and Morty episodes, along with their name and air date.
- Episode Details: View detailed information about a selected episode, including a list of characters that appeared in the episode and their roles.

**Architecture:**

- This application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. The model layer is responsible for fetching and processing data from the API. The view layer displays the data to the user and captures user input. The view model layer acts as a mediator between the view and model layers, processing user input and providing data to the view layer.

**Libraries and Frameworks:**

- SwiftyJSON: Used for parsing JSON data received from the API.

- UIKit: Used for building the user interface of the application
